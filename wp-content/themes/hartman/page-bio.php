					<h1>Dallas W. Hartman</h1>
					
					<span class="my_excerpt">Dallas W. Hartman, principal at the law firm bearing his name, focuses his practice on personal injury, medical malpractice, legal malpractice and workers' compensation in Pennsylvania and Ohio.</span>
					
					
					<p>"Not all attorneys are equal. Therefore, the attorney you chose does make a difference." From highly complex litigation to routine auto cases Attorney Hartman believes each client deserves the attention that a corporate attorney gives a major corporation.</p>

					<p>An honors graduate of Youngstown State University and the Dickinson School of Law, Hartman began practicing law in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1984. Dallas has been listed as one of the top 5% of lawyers in Pennsylvania by Super Lawyers Magazine and has been selected as one of the Top 50 Super Lawyers in Pittsburgh since 2012. He was proud to be included as one of the Top 100 Super Lawyers in Pennsylvania in 2013 and 2016. In addition, he was recognized by Newsweek magazine as a Leader in Product Liability Litigation. He is a lifetime member of the Million Dollar Advocates and the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates and is listed as one of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers.</p>

					<p>"Maybe, my clients are more important to me because they are real people with real problems that all of us can understand," says Dallas. "Our legal system only works when clients are represented by attorneys with the knowledge, ability and resources to take a case to trial and through the appellate process."</p>
